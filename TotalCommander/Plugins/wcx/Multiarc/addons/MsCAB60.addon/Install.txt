   *** Installation for Windows Commander + MultiArc ***

IMPORTANT: Use MultiArc 1.0.0.9 -- MsCab 0.60 doesn't work
                                   with MultiArc 1.0.0.8!

First of all you should decide, if your primary use of MsCab is to
make standard CAB archives or backup your private data. If you want
to make standard CAB archives, please use NoDirs\MsCab060.addon
(you can enter '-dirs' option for packing empty dirs).
If you want to use MsCab for backup private data, please use MsCab060.addon
(you can enter '-dirs-' option for creating standard CAB archives).

To install MsCab - copy MsCab.exe to hard drive, copy contents
of MsCab060.addon to your MultiArc.ini file, edit "Archiver" key to adjust
it to real placement of your MsCab.exe (default 'c:\Utils\MsCab.exe')
and associate CAB extension with MultiArc.wcx (in Windows Commander:
Configuration/Options/Packer/Configure packer extension DLLs
type cab in 'All files with extension (ending with)', press 'New type...'
button and choose MultiArc.wcx).

If you have external SFX modules for MsCab, put them in the same directory
as the MsCab.exe. If you want to replace default (included in MsCab.exe)
en_i.MsCabSFX module with another, simply copy that module
to Default.MsCabSFX file (in the same directory as the MsCab.exe).

If you don't have external SFX modules, you can visit http://www.mscab.prv.pl
and download them.

WARNING: You must use MultiArc 1.0.0.9 or above.


   *** Installation for FAR File and Archive Manager ***

If you want to use 'Cab.fmt' from MsCab package, you can delete
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\CAB
key from registry (or double-click 'FAR - CAB-.reg'). If you
prefer original 'Cab.fmt', you should use 'FAR - MsCab060.reg'.

You should decide, if your primary use of MsCab is to make standard
CAB archives or backup your private data. If you want to make standard
CAB archives, please use files ('Cab.fmt' or 'FAR - MsCab060.reg')
from NoDirs subdirectory. Otherwise you should use files from base dir
of MsCab package. You can enter '-dirs' or '-dirs-' option for storing or
not storing dirs’ names.

To install MsCab - copy MsCab.exe to directory pointed by PATH
(i.e. '\WINDOWS\COMMAND') and double-click 'FAR - MsCab060.reg' or
copy 'Cab.fmt' to "\Program Files\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\Formats\Cab.fmt".

If you have external SFX modules for MsCab, put them in the same directory
as the MsCab.exe. If you want to replace default (included in MsCab.exe)
en_i.MsCabSFX module with another, simply copy that module
to Default.MsCabSFX file (in the same directory as the MsCab.exe).

If you don't have external SFX modules, you can visit http://www.mscab.prv.pl
and download them.
