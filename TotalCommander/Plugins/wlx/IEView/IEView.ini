[Signatures]
; This section contains signatures that IEView uses to verify file formats before passing to IE.
; This is a protective measure against some undesired behavior or even crashes that may occur
; if file extension does not correspond to file format. All signatures are optional; if there is
; a signature for file extension, and first bytes of a file do not match the signature, IEView
; ignores the file. Signatures here are in form of hex byte sequence, or a quoted string. There may
; be more than one signature for an extension. In this case, file is viewed if first bytes of the
; file match at least one of them.
